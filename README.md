In this project under the Turin University, together with the Parco Naturale delle Alpi Marittime, we proposed an 
ODE dynamical system to model three populations in the still water of Italy, namely:

* Procamburus Clarkii, an invasive species of crayfish which was imported in Europe from America

* Austropotamobius pallipes italicus, a native crayfish species from Italy, endangered by competion and by illness 
brought by the Procamburus Clarkii

* Aphanomyces astaci, a fungi which parasitizes crayfishes, it doesn't affect the life of Procamburus Clarkii but 
ususally kills in few days the native specie.
